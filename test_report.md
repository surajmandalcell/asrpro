# ASR Pro Node.js Backend Test Report

## Executive Summary

I've conducted a thorough analysis of the ASR Pro Node.js backend that will replace the Python sidecar. The backend is built using Express.js with TypeScript and provides REST API endpoints and WebSocket support for audio transcription services.

## Testing Environment

- **Platform**: Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
- **Node.js Version**: v24.9.0
- **Docker Version**: 28.5.0
- **GPU Support**: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support detected

## Backend Structure Analysis

### Components

The backend consists of the following key components:

1. **Server (`server.ts`)**: Main Express server setup with Socket.IO integration
2. **Routes**: API endpoint handlers
   - Health check (`/health`)
   - Models (`/v1/models`)
   - Settings (`/v1/settings/model`)
   - Transcription (`/v1/audio/transcriptions`)
   - Options (`/v1/options`)
3. **Services**:
   - Configuration service (`configService.ts`)
   - Docker service (`dockerService.ts`)
   - Audio service (`audioService.ts`)
4. **Utilities**:
   - Logger (`logger.ts`)
   - Error handling (`errors.ts`)

### Architecture

The backend follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- Express.js for HTTP routing
- Socket.IO for WebSocket communication
- Dockerode for Docker container management
- Fluent-ffmpeg for audio processing
- Multer for file uploads
- Electron-store for configuration management

## API Endpoint Testing

### 1. Health Check Endpoint (`GET /health`)

**Status**: ✅ Working
**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "ready",
  "device": "Docker container (GPU)"
}
```

### 2. Models Endpoint (`GET /v1/models`)

**Status**: ✅ Working
**Response**:
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "whisper-tiny",
      "ready": false
    },
    {
      "id": "whisper-base",
      "ready": false
    },
    {
      "id": "whisper-small",
      "ready": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Options Endpoint (`GET /v1/options`)

**Status**: ✅ Working
**Response**: Comprehensive API documentation with endpoint descriptions, parameters, and examples.

### 4. Model Setting Endpoint (`POST /v1/settings/model`)

**Status**: ❌ Not Working
**Error**:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "DOCKER_ERROR",
    "message": "Failed to start container: (HTTP code 404) unexpected - pull access denied for asrpro/whisper-base, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied"
  }
}
```

**Issue**: The backend is trying to pull Docker images (asrpro/whisper-base) that don't exist in the repository.

### 5. Transcription Endpoint (`POST /v1/audio/transcriptions`)

**Status**: ❌ Not Working
**Issue**: The endpoint becomes unresponsive when processing audio files. This is likely related to the Docker container issue since transcription requires the model containers to be running.

## WebSocket Functionality

**Status**: ⚠️ Partially Working
- WebSocket server initializes correctly
- Emits Docker initialization events
- Not fully tested due to server stability issues

## Docker Integration

**Status**: ⚠️ Partially Working
- Docker daemon detection works
- GPU resource detection works
- Container management fails due to missing images
- Container allocation system appears well-implemented

## Audio Processing Capabilities

**Status**: ⚠️ Partially Working
- Audio service initializes correctly
- Format validation is implemented
- Audio conversion support is available (via FFmpeg)
- Not fully tested due to server stability issues

## Configuration Management

**Status**: ✅ Working
- Configuration service initializes correctly
- Server settings are loaded properly
- Default configuration is applied

## Error Handling Mechanisms

**Status**: ✅ Well Implemented
- Custom error classes are defined
- Error middleware is set up
- Proper error responses are formatted
- Unhandled exceptions are caught

## Server Stability Issues

The primary issue identified is server stability. The server:
- Initializes correctly
- Responds to simple requests (health, models, options)
- Becomes unresponsive when trying to set models or process transcriptions
- Crashes when handling complex requests

Most likely causes:
1. Missing Docker images for Whisper models
2. Unhandled exceptions in the transcription workflow
3. Memory issues when processing audio files

## Recommendations

### 1. Docker Image Issue

**Priority**: High
**Solution**: Build or provide access to the required Docker images (asrpro/whisper-base, etc.)

### 2. Error Handling

**Priority**: Medium
**Solution**: Add more robust error handling for the transcription workflow, especially when Docker containers are not available.

### 3. Fallback Mechanism

**Priority**: Medium
**Solution**: Implement a fallback mechanism that returns mock transcriptions when Docker containers are not available, similar to the Python implementation.

### 4. Request Timeouts

**Priority**: Low
**Solution**: Implement request timeouts to prevent hanging requests.

## Conclusion

The Node.js backend is well-architected and provides a solid foundation for the ASR Pro application. The main issues are related to missing Docker images for the Whisper models and server stability when handling complex requests. With these issues resolved, the backend should provide full functionality comparable to the Python sidecar.

## Testing Notes

1. All tests were conducted on a Linux system with NVIDIA GPU support.
2. The backend was running in development mode with debug logging enabled.
3. Some tests were limited due to server stability issues.
4. The backend was tested both as a standalone server and within the Electron application context.
