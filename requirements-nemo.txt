# OPTIONAL: Parakeet / NeMo extras (separate to avoid Windows build pain).
# Install Microsoft C++ Build Tools first if you want texterrors etc.
# If you only use Whisper you can skip this file entirely.

# Core already installed: torch, torchaudio, numpy, omegaconf
# Choose a stable NeMo release instead of main to reduce breakage.
# 2.0.x / 2.1.x had broad adoption; pin a recent non-RC if available.
# Using 2.5.0 here (adjust if newer stable works better for you).

nemo_toolkit[asr]==2.5.0

# Some NeMo extras expect these versions (ensure not newer major):
pyannote.core==5.0.0
pyannote.metrics==3.2.1
editdistance==0.8.1
jiwer==3.1.0
webdataset==1.0.2

# If texterrors build fails and you don't need its alignment utilities, you may omit it:
# texterrors==0.5.1
